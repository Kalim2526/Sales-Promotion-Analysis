# ðŸš€ AtliQ Mart's Sales & Promotion Analysis ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¼

I am thrilled to share the Codebasics 9th Challenge on Sales & Promotion Analysis at AtliQ Mart, a leading retail giant with a stronghold in Southern India. Through meticulous data analysis using PowerBI & MySQL, I had revealed actionable insights that will shape the future promotional strategies & drive sustainable growth.

## Introduction: 

AtliQ Mart's 50 supermarkets had big promotions during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. They wanted to sell more and make more people know about their products.



## Key Findings:

### 1. Store Performance Analysis:

Store STCHE-4 did really well, but Store STMLR-0 needs some improvements.

Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad had really good sales, showing how people buy differently in different places.

### 2. Promotion Type Analysis:

Promotions offering $500 Cashback & BOGOF (Buy One Get One Free) deals made the most money, showing they work well.

These deals made up a huge 81.87% of all the money made, meaning customers really like them.

The BOGOF deal was the best, giving customers a good deal while keeping them interested.

### 3. Product & Category Analysis:

Grocery & Staples were the most popular items, showing how important they are for the customers' shopping needs.

And many more Insights......................... 



## Learnings:

Understanding what customers like helps make promotions work.

Using tools like PowerBI & MySQL helps make smart decisions.

Checking how well promotions work helps make them better next time.

Different places need different kinds of promotions.


## Tools Used: 
PowerBI, MySQL, Microsoft Powerpoint (Video Presentation)



## Thank You:
